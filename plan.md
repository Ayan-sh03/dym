# Modular Production Plan for Implementing Google's "Did You Mean" Feature

## 1. Overview
This document details a modular, production-ready plan for implementing a "Did you mean" feature similar to Google Search.
The design leverages global language models, personalized signals, and efficient candidate generation to provide real-time corrections.

## 2. Architecture and Modular Components
- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing Module**: Normalizes and tokenizes user queries.
- **Candidate Generation Module**: Uses indexed lookup, edit distance, and phonetic matching.
- **Ranking Module**: Ranks candidates using n-gram probabilities and personalization weights.
- **Correction Decision Module**: Evaluates top candidates and determines if a suggestion should be triggered.
- **Microservices Integration Module**: Exposes functionalities via REST API through an API Gateway.
- **Caching & Scalability Module**: Uses caching (e.g., Redis) and load balancing for high availability.
- **Monitoring & Logging Module**: Captures system performance metrics and user interactions.

## 3. Detailed Module Description

### 3.1 Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
- **Input Processing**: Lowercase conversion, diacritic removal, and punctuation normalization.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting query into tokens for individual analysis.
- **User Profile Extraction**: Fetches historical data to enable personalization.

### 3.2 Candidate Generation
- **Lookup Mechanism**: Retrieve candidate words based on an indexed dictionary of query logs.
- **Edit Distance Filtering**: Use Levenshtein distance to select plausible candidates.
- **Phonetic Matching**: Incorporate sound-based algorithms for homophone corrections.

### 3.3 Candidate Ranking
- **Global Language Model Scoring**: Utilize n-gram models trained on large query datasets.
- **Personalization Weighting**: Blend in user-specific signals to adjust rankings.
- **Thresholding**: Set performance thresholds to determine when to suggest a correction.

### 3.4 Correction Decision Logic
- **Real-Time Processing**: Evaluate candidate scores asynchronously as users type.
- **Suggestion Trigger**: Display “Did you mean” prompt if a significantly better candidate is determined.
- **Result Caching**: Cache frequent corrections to minimize latency.

### 3.5 Microservices and Integration
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for client search queries, handling authentication and rate limiting.
- **Service Orchestration**: Use load balancers and auto-scaling to distribute traffic.
- **Service Communication**: Utilize REST or gRPC for low-latency communication among services.
